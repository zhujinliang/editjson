There are a few things that I am either currently working on, or going to 
work on in the near future. They are:
1.Since I didn't spend much time plan the all structure of the progrom, the 
data structures is so poor that it is difficult to add more function to the 
software. Therefore, I am considering it is necessary to plan and design 
the data structures again.

2.Use dynamic list to store the screen data.

3.Add PageUP and PageDown key function, just like the general txt editor.

4.Add the function: insert, add or delet an item to json.

5.Add or reserve the interface of check valid input based on the syntax or 
other principle.
