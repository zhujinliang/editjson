Overview:
----------
editjson is an json structure file editor that based on termbox libray and 
cJSON libray. It can be used to edit json structure file. You can use it open 
a json structure file in a terminal user interface, in which you can modify 
the content of json structure clearly. 
JSON is described best here: http://www.json.org/
It's like XML, but fat-free. You use it to move data around, store things, 
or just generally represent your program's state.
editjson is just like but smaller, lighter and more portable than the jsonedit 
which is also a terminal-based application for working with JSON. It's based 
on urwid, an excellent Python-based library for building terminal-based user 
interfaces. Get more information on this: http://robla.net/jsonwidget/


How to use:
---------
There is two examples in the package, test.c is for shell command to call and 
example is for C to call. 
Do as this:
cd editjson
make test    #compile the test,then will creat "editjson" which is an 
             #executable file. 
make example #compile the example, then will creat "Ejson" which is an 
             #executable file. 

Then there will be an executable file exists. Now, you can run it by clicking 
"./editjson" or "./Ejson" into the terminal.

In the "editjson", you can do these:
1.If you don't open a json file, it will open test.json(which is in the same 
directory) as the schema.

2.Of course, you can creat a new json file by assigning a schema. Just do like 
this: ./editjson -s [the schema file] newjsonfile

3.If you open a json file or creat a new json file, you can input some content 
in the item, just as you do in other txt editor. You can use Backspace key, 
Delete key. What's more, you can add or insert content in the anywhere of the 
item content.

4.If your work is done, you can use Ctrl+W to save your work, use Ctrl+W to exit
the software. If your file is modified, it will note you to save or not save when 
you want to exit.

Notice:
1.PageUP and PageDown key can not be used in the software. If your json 
information can not be all displayed in the edit screen, you can try to change 
the size of terminal window to display more.

2.You can't insert, add or delet an item to json, but these function may be added
in the future's version.

3.When you run "Ejson", you must input a json file name after the "./Ejson".

File:

address, up, test.json are all json file which is an example for you to use.
